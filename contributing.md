# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project üôåüèª.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before contributing:** If you are having any problem or want to request a new feature, please check first if there is an open issue about it and nobody is working on it. If there is no open issues for your situation, please open an issue and fill one of the templates.

## Setup

Since we want to make things easy for you and avoid polluting your environment, you will only need [Docker](https://docker.com), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed.

This folder contains a [Visual Studio Code development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial) with the required environment setup for this project. Once you fork, clone and open the project, you will see a prompt asking you to reopen the project in a container.

Once you reopen in container, all dependencies will be automatically installed and you will be ready to add your awesome contribution üòé.

## Sending your changes

So you finished your new kick ass **feature**, life saving **bugfix**, confidence boost **test** or user engaging **documentation**. Now what?

First, make sure everything works by running `npm run validate`. Although this will be also validated on the CI system, it will anticipate any issue and avoid you further work to pass the CI.

Once you are sure there is no validation issues, go ahead and open a PR and wait for your awesome work to be included ‚ú®.

Thanks ‚ô•Ô∏è.
